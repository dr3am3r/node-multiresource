# Simple module to get multiple resources from a REST expressjs server

### Status
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dr3am3r/node-multiresource.png)](https://travis-ci.org/dr3am3r/node-multiresource)

* Requirements: node.js 0.10.x and newer, Express 4.x.x
* Only native Nodejs APIs are used for module itself + stuff for tests
* Both http and https are supported
* Run node examples/server.js for usage example, you probably need to run it with extra permissions to allow 443 port to be used

### Warning
If you want to run tests make sure that this module works: https://github.com/ericallam/express-mock-request (there is unaccepted pull request at this moment)
