*** Simple module to get multiple resources from a REST expressjs server

* Requirements: node.js 0.10.x and newer, Express 4.x.x
* Only native Nodejs APIs are used for module itself + stuff for tests
* Both http and https are supported
* See example.js for usage example, you probably need to run it with extra permissions to allow 443 port to be used
